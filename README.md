# Evaluation Dashboard App - Mentor View
This is a Flutter web application designed as a mentor-view solution for evaluating students during a semester-long project in college.
The app is hosted [here](https://scaler-assignment-two.vercel.app/).

## Description

The Evaluation Dashboard App - Mentor View provides mentors with the capability to assign students for evaluation, assess them based on predefined parameters, and manage the evaluation process efficiently. Mentors can add, edit, or remove assigned students, assign marks to each student, and submit final evaluations. Additionally, mentors can filter students based on their evaluation status.

## Requirements

- Mentors can assign students for evaluation, with each mentor able to accommodate a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 4 students at a time.
- Mentors must assign marks to each student based on various parameters.
- Total marks should be visible to the mentor.
- Mentors can edit or remove assigned students and marks, satisfying the same conditions as when adding a new student.
- Final submission locks the marks, making them uneditable thereafter. Mentors cannot submit if some students have unassigned marks.
- View page for mentors to see all students and assigned marks, with filters for unassigned and assigned students.

## Note

- No login/signup pages are included; it's assumed only mentors will access the app.
- Frontend developed as a Single Page Application (SPA).
